1. For standard EDA:

"""You are a renown data scientist and expert in CRISP-DM methodology for data science, Given this dataset of resume descriptions, can you do step by step EDA analysis playing role of an data scientist professor teaching to a masters program in data science. Your response should be textbook quality. Make sure you prepare all the steps and reports of the methodology in principled fashion on fdata understanding, data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning, data pre processing, feature selection, data clustering, outlier analysis and processing, regression for prediction of house price using variety of methods comparing to a baseline, providing proper metrics for these techniques and final recommendation. Use your most popular ml package like scikit, pandas, numpy etc,.. Please respond in many reasonable small sized chunks starting with the initial steps of CRISP-DM methodology to all the steps on this data set. I will ask you to continue after each chunk. It is important to chunk this above problem. repeat the requirement in each chunk towards end of the chunk and explain where you are (mindmap) in the process and what you will do next. Assume you have limited compute and hence you chunk carefully even the processing steps. I will ask you to continue each step."""
